# Sniff_Tool_Python
These are basic scanners.

They can check the number of devices connected to your network and print their local IP addresses along with their MAC addresses.

Sniff_Tool.py
I have used argparse and scapy to make this basic network scanner.

[Syntax : python <file_name> -ip <ip_address>/<subnet>]

[NOTE : Use it with root/administrative priviledges]

One needs to have argparse and scapy installed.

They can be installed with :

pip install argparse

pip install scapy
